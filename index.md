# Call for Entries
The California Map Society and the David Rumsey Map Center invite all US-based students of higher education to apply for an opportunity to curate an exhibition of maps from our collections based on the topic of the applicant’s choice. Proposals will be judged on the strength of the topic, the effective use of maps in support of the topic, and overall quality of research and writing.
